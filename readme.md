# General notes
I wasn't sure if I was supposed to code the application or the API or both, so I started with what seemed to be the easiest to complete most of, that being the app.

While I was able to finish the app to a satisfactory degree, I had not had time to start the API.

# What I would like to do if had more time
- Fix an error where the robot is unable to accept the forward command with more than one digit (limited to 0-9 movement at a time)
- Implement validations on the robot input
- Implement more tests to reflect these fixes
- Develop the API in its entirety
